Monty Interpreter

Welcome to the Monty Interpreter README! This interpreter is designed to read and execute Monty byte code files, which contain instructions for manipulating a stack data structure. Here are some guidelines for using the Monty Interpreter:

General Guidelines:

Argument Check: Ensure that the interpreter is provided with one argument (e.g., the Monty byte code file). If no file or more than one file is provided, display a usage message: USAGE: monty file and exit with failure.
File Opening: If the specified file cannot be opened, display an error message: Error: Can't open file and exit with failure.
File Parsing:

Reading File: Read each line of the Monty byte code file.
Line Validation: Skip lines with less than three characters, as opcode lines are expected to be at least three characters long (excluding whitespace). This effectively skips empty lines.
Tokenizing Lines: Tokenize each line to extract individual opcodes and arguments.
Opcode Validation: Check if the extracted opcode is valid.
If valid, execute the corresponding command.
If not valid, display an error message in the format L<line_number>: unknown instruction <opcode> and exit with failure.
Error Handling:

Memory Allocation: Display an error message Error: malloc failed and exit with failure if memory allocation fails. Ensure proper usage of malloc and free.
Push Command: If the push command is provided without an integer argument or with a non-integer argument, display a usage message: L<line_number>: usage: push integer.
Overflow Handling: No need to handle stack overflow cases.
Stack Manipulation Commands:

pall: Print all values of the stack if it is not empty, starting from the top.
pint: Print the top value of the stack.
pop: Remove the top element of the stack.
swap: Swap the top two elements of the stack.
add: Add the top two elements of the stack.
nop: Do nothing.
Other Commands:

sub, div, mul, mod: Perform subtraction, division, multiplication, and modulo operations, respectively.
pchar, pstr: Print the character at the top of the stack or print the string starting from the top of the stack.
rotl, rotr: Rotate the stack to the left or right.
stack, queue: Set the stack format to stack (LIFO) or queue (FIFO).
Character Flag:

Use a character flag (1 if a character is passed, 2 if a character followed by space and then argument) to differentiate between character and integer inputs.
